# Because this library provides extension modules for macOS, but not for other
# platforms, we want to provide built distributions for each macOS platform, but we
# explicitly DON'T want to provide a cross-platform pure-Python wheel to fall back on.
#
# This is because in the event that a new Python version is released or a new
# macOS platform is released, macOS users won't be able to install the built
# distributions we've provided and should fall back to the source distribution,
# but pip's behavior is to prefer a pure-Python wheel first, which will be
# missing the extension modules.
#
# However, to provide built distributions for Linux and Windows (which don't
# have extension modules) we can just build a pure-Python wheel on that
# platform and override the platform name manually via wheel's --plat-name
# feature, to provide a platform-specific wheel for all platforms.
